The research question to be answered is as follows. What is the charge carrier density of silver? The experimental results are as follows. The Hall coefficient of silver is determined to be:
        $R_H = (8.3 \pm 2) \cdot 10^{-11} \text{m$^3$C$^{-1}$}$. 
The literature value for the Hall coefficient of silver is \cite{apparatus_silver}
        $ \mid R_{H}_{ literature} \mid = (8,9 \pm 2) \cdot 10^{-11}
        \text{m$^3$C$^{-1}$}$.
The charge carrier density of silver is determined to be
$
        n = (7.4 \pm 2)\cdot 10^{28} \text{m$^{-3}$}.
$
Of which the literature value is equal to \cite{apparatus_silver}
$
        n_{literature} = (6.6 \pm 2)\cdot 10^{28} \quad \text{m$^{-3}$}.
$
Out of these results it is concluded that the experimental results are in agreement with the literature values.
