\chapter{Introduction}

The Hall voltage is a voltage due to the Hall effect. This effect is often use in modern equipment. In this report the Hall effect will be explained and used to measure the hall voltage. The Hall coefficient is defined as the ratio of the induced electric field to the product of the current density and the applied magnetic field. This coefficient depends on the material from which the conductor is made. In this experiment, the material that will be used to measure the Hall voltage is silver. 

\\
The research question is as follows:
 \begin{itemize}
     \item  What is the charge carrier density of silver?
 \end{itemize}
